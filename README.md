Server
======

If you would like to host a server head into the server directory and put all the music that you'd like to stream in the music folder, then run server.py. It will run on port 5555


Client
======


Open config.py and edit the ip and port with the server that you would like to stream from. Once that is done, run gui.py and hit the play button.
